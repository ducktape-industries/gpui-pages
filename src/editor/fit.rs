//! Sizing an input to the text in it, by measurement rather than assumption.
//!
//! Every text area in this editor — a block, a table cell — is sized to its
//! own content, because the document, not the input, decides how tall things
//! are. That only works if the height handed to an input leaves room for the
//! text after the input has taken its own padding out of it, and that padding
//! is not a number an application can know: it depends on the component, on
//! the theme and on the display, whose device pixels the text area is snapped
//! to. A text area even a fraction short of its text scrolls inside itself as
//! the caret moves between rows, and the text visibly jumps.
//!
//! So the gap is measured. [`InputFit`] remembers what an input did with the
//! height it was given last frame and asks for more when it came up short.
